<p align="justify">The main objetive of this project was about the design and implementation of a pair of omni-directional robots which had an incorporated system of parabolic throwing. They were developed as a solution for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8daR6qBw3M" target="_blank">2015-2016 VEX Competition: Nothing But Net</a>. These robots were used to compete as in the 2015 VEX Robotics Colombian National Championship as in the 2016 VEX Robotics World Championship.</p>
