<p align="justify">The main objective of this project was about designing, implementing, and validating a board for testing mixed-signal systems able to provide not only many high-resolution low-noise output voltages, but also the possibility to digitally tune them (through an Arduino board or FPGA), as well as able to allow the user to turn them on/off, to digitally read their voltage and current, and to program his own system (DUT).</p>
