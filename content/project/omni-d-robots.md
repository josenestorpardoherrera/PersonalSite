*(Jul 2015 - Jun 2016)*

The main objetive of this project was about the design and implementation of a pair of omni-directional robots which had an incorporated system of parabolic throwing. They were developed as a solution for the 2015-2016 VEX Competition: Nothing But Net. These robots were used to compete as in the 2015 VEX Robotics Colombian National Championship as in the 2016 VEX Robotics World Championship.
