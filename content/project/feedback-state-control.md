<p align="justify">The main objective of this project was about designing, implementing and simulating - in Simulink-Matlab - a control system by feedback state law for a spark ignition engine MIMO model, provided by Toyota Motor Corporation for the <a href="/img/ecc15_student_competition.pdf" target="_blank">student competition at European Control Conference 2015 (ECC 2015)</a>. In fact, this project was my undergraduate thesis.</p>
